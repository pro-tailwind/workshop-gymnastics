# Pro Tailwind: Advanced Tailwind CSS Gymnastics

Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm excited to go through this upcoming workshop with you ðŸŽ‰

This repo contains the workshop challenges we'll be working on.

You can access this site at https://css-gymnastics.protailwind.com

Technically, you don't have to install anything on your machine, since we'll be working with Tailwind Play and StackBlitz. It's here if you want to run the site locally, but it's not a strict requirement to get it set up for the workshop.

### Get ready to stretch those CSS muscles!

Together, we'll deconstruct interesting parts of the [Calendar Booking App](https://calendar-app.protailwind.com) and work our CSS gymnastics with some fun challenges!

I think you're in for a good time. But before we get started, let's go over some formalities and housekeeping around the workshop.

### Focus groups & breakout rooms

You'll be split in small focus groups for today's workshop challenges. This consists of separate "breakout rooms", where each member of the group will take turns "driving" a challenge by sharing their screen.

The groups will remain the same for the entire workshop.

At the end of challenges, we'll all come back together to discuss. "Pairing" in small groups and actively participating to group discusions are key to this workshop. They'll help you maximise your learning experience.

I really encourage everyone to participate actively, ask questions, and of course be supportive of one another!

### Aaaand... who am I?

I'm Simon, your workshop instructor. ðŸ‘‹

If you've watched some YouTube videos from the Tailwind Labs channel, you've most probably seen my face already!

I love utility-first CSS. I've been supporting and promoting this styling approach even before Tailwind CSS existed! I'm a front-end developer, designer and content creator.

I bring a lot of enthusiasm and positive energy in everything I do, this is just how I'm wired up!

I have been teaching in-person workshops for multiple senior engineering teams, and a constant piece of feedback I get is my workshops are exciting, fun and engaging. To me, that's the best way to learn!

I sometimes speak at conferences and meetups. I make YouTube videos and I'm also an instructor on [egghead.io](https://egghead.io).

You can connect with me on Twitter, I'm [simonswiss](https://twitter.com/simonswiss) ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡­

I'm super excited to dive into this workshop with you.
