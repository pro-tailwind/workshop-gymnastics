# Pro Tailwind: Advanced Gymanstics

This repo contains all the fun warm-up exercies to be used throughough the workshop days when a change of pace is needed, or to warm up at the start of the day.

The idea is to start each workshop with a couple (or just one) challenge from this resource, before jumping into the main topic.

These challenges will also be available on Tailwind Play (HTML) and CodeSandbox (JSX). This will allow learners to share their solution/problems, which can be discussed with the workshop group if they're comfortable with it!

If need be (change of pace, "pick me up", extra time), more challenges can be tackled during the workshop. A useful tool for both the audience and the instructor!
