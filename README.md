# Pro Tailwind: Exctracting Reusable UI Components

The Pro Tailwind Advanced Gymnastics is a series of CSS deep dives into some of the most interesting parts of the Booking UI application.

Rather than building the entire app from scratch, we explore isolated portions of the UI which present interesting CSS challenges and techniques.

This workshop is all about CSS techniques, and how to tackle those with Tailwind CSS.

A fun, entertaining half-day workshop which is likely to bring a few "AHA!" moments to even seasoned CSS developers!

_Note:_ These challenges will also be available on Tailwind Play (HTML) and CodeSandbox (JSX). This will allow learners to share their solution/problems, which can be discussed with the workshop group if they're comfortable with it!

Some of the challenges in this repo will also be used as a warm-up exercies in other Pro Tailwind workshops. The idea is to start each workshop with a challenge from this resource, before jumping into the main topic.

If need be (change of pace, "pick me up", extra time), more challenges can be tackled during the workshop. A useful tool for both the audience and the instructor!

## Who's the teacher?

Hey!

I'm Simon, and I will be your workshop instructor. If you've watched some YouTube videos from the Tailwind Labs channel, you've most probably seen my face already!

I love utility-first CSS. I've been supporting and promoting this styling approach even before Tailwind CSS existed!

I'm a front-end developer, designer and content creator. I bring a lot of entusiasm and positive energy in everything I do, this is just how I'm wired up!

I think I'm really good at teaching stuff, and make people excited to learn new things.

I have been teaching in-person workshops for multiple senior engineering teams (Atlassian), and a constant piece of feedback I get is my workshops are exciting, fun and engaging.

And to me, that's the best way to learn!

I've been speaking at conferences, meetups, and I'm also an instructor on egghead.io

Oh, and I recently started a podcast with my new friend Jon Myers - it's called The NavBar, you should check it out!

You can connect with me on Twitter, I'm [@simonswiss](https://twitter.com/simonswiss).

I'm super excited to dive into this workshop with you.
