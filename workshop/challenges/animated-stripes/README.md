### 🎯 Challenge

[Start demo](https://css-gymnastics.protailwind.com/challenges/animated-stripes/start) | [Finish demo](https://css-gymnastics.protailwind.com/solutions/animated-stripes)

Let's create some background stripes! Before worrying about animating those, try to nail down the 4 different stripe patterns that you can see on the Figma file.

Black stripes, white stripes, "inverted" stripes. 🦓

If you've got no idea were to start, don't worry - I'll drop a few hints progressively during the challenge.

You might need to write some custom CSS here. Actually, I pulled it off 100% within the HTML, but... I don't recommend it. I _may_ show you the questionable arbitrary, "on-demand" Tailwind classes I came up with 😅

### 🌶 Extra sauce

[Extra demo](https://css-gymnastics.protailwind.com/solutions/animated-stripes/extra)

You've got them stripes working? Good work! Now try and add the animation!

### 🌶🌶 Extra spicy sauce

Want all the sauce, eh?

Aiight then.

Create `stripes-size-*` modifier utility classes you can compose with the `stripes` class.

Those should support `sm`, `lg` and `xl` values that alter the default's `stripes` size (as in, how often they "repeat").

Finally, sprinkle a Carolina Reaper on top (🌶🌶🌶🌶🥵) by also supporting... [arbitrary values](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-custom-styles#using-arbitrary-values)!

### 🤞 Good luck everybody!

You've got this. Have fun!

### 🙈 Code solutions

Those represent _one way_ of implementing this challenge. They are definitely not the only possible approach!

Also: try not look at these too early. Struggling is good and part of the learning process!
