### üéØ Challenge

[Start demo](https://css-gymnastics.protailwind.com/challenges/slide-in-confirmation/start) | [Finish demo](https://css-gymnastics.protailwind.com/solutions/slide-in-confirmation)

Let's add some spice to our time picker by sliding-in a confirmation button when the time is pressed.

The Figma file can't really show this, but have a look at the [Finish demo](https://css-gymnastics.protailwind.com/solutions/slide-in-confirmation) to see what I mean.

We're using `JSX` for this example just so that we can keep track of the `selectedTime` state, and loop over some time availabilities.

To add animated stripes to an element, you can use the custom `bg-stripes` utility class - don't build that from scratch in this challenge!

### üôà Code solutions

Those represent _one way_ of implementing this challenge. They are definitely not the only possible approach!

Also: try not look at these too early. Struggling is good and part of the learning process!
