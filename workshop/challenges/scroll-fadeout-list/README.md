[Start demo](https://css-gymnastics.protailwind.com/challenges/scroll-fadeout-list/start) | [Finish demo](https://css-gymnastics.protailwind.com/solutions/scroll-fadeout-list)

Your challenge is to fix that, so that users can see every option available.

If you've got the scroll list working, try adding some delight by implementing a nice "fade-out" effect at the bottom of the scroll container, as you can see in the Figma file.
