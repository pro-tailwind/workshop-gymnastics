[Start demo](https://css-gymnastics.protailwind.com/challenges/scroll-fadeout-list/start) | [Finish demo](https://css-gymnastics.protailwind.com/solutions/scroll-fadeout-list)

Scrolling containers are often confusing to implement. In the starting point code, the list of available times is broken: it's not scrolling.

Your challenge is to fix that, so that users can see every option available.

[Extra demo](https://css-gymnastics.protailwind.com/solutions/scroll-fadeout-list/extra)

If you've got the scroll list working, try adding some delight by implementing a nice "fade-out" effect at the bottom of the scroll container, as you can see in the Figma file.
