### üéØ Challenge

This ribbon banner has some surprisingly sneaky bits. When prototyping it, I always found myslef reaching for "magic numbers", to nudge the ribbon into the right place.

That's usually not a great thing.

I eventually figured out something that I was happy with. There are definitely multiple ways to solve this, and I'm looking forward to see what approach you'll take.

Make sure you collaborate on this, because there are quite a few creative ideas that can help!

If you're stuck - don't worry! Struggling for a bit is good. I'll drop some hints, jump in your breakout room answer questions if you need help.

When the time is up, I'll walk everyone through my implementation, and we'll review and discuss what other groups came up with.

If you've completed the challenge, try create the same ribbon on the top left corner as well!

This should expose a few interesting points you'd consider if you were to create a re-usable Ribbon component with custom parameters.

### ü§û Good luck everybody!

You've got this. Have fun!

### üôà Code solutions

Those represent _one way_ of implementing this challenge. They are definitely not the only possible approach!

Also: try not look at these too early. Struggling is good and part of the learning process!
