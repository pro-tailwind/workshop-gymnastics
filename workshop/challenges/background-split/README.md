### üéØ Challenge

[Start demo](https://css-gymnastics.protailwind.com/challenges/background-split/start) | [Finish demo](https://css-gymnastics.protailwind.com/solutions/background-split)

Let's make the page background a bit more interesting by adding a "color split" that vertically aligns with the card panels.

We're only doing this when the card panels are side-by-side. Don't worry about smaller screens where the panels are stacked.

Again, there are multiple ways to go about it. Let's see what you come up with!

Those represent _one way_ of implementing this challenge. They are definitely not the only possible approach!

Also: try not look at these too early. Struggling is good and part of the learning process!
