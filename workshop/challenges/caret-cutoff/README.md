### üå∂ Extra sauce

[Extra demo](/solutions/caret-cutoff/extra)

If you managed to get the caret working on the desktop view, try making it work for smaller screens as well, when the panels are stacked.

The design is up to you, but I imagine the caret should point downwards instead of to the right in that scenario.

### üôà Code solutions

Those represent _one way_ of implementing this challenge. They are definitely not the only possible approach!

Also: try not look at these too early. Struggling is good and part of the learning process!
